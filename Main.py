The two protagonists, Tiffy Moore and Leon Twomey, are immensely likeable and the comic situation they find themselves in is entirely believable. Tiffy works in publishing and needs a cheap flat while palliative nurse Leon works nights and needs extra cash. The pair agree to share a one-bed flat, with Tiffy sleeping there at nights and weekends and Leon using it by day. It sounds simple, but with Tiffy‚Äôs horrible ex-boyfriend, demanding clients at work, Leon‚Äôs wrongly imprisoned brother and the fact that they still haven‚Äôt met, the situation gets more complicated by the day.'

Queenie Jenkins is a young black woman who‚Äôs just broken up with her long-term boyfriend, Tom. Her boss at the newspaper where she works doesn‚Äôt appreciate her and her family never listens (they‚Äôre not interested unless the conversation is about Jesus or water rates). A fresh, funny and at times painful read.'

Macneal is a writer and potter and worked in the City for several years before completing a creative writing MA at the University of East Anglia. Set amid the squalor and chaos of Victorian London, The Doll Factory is the tale of aspiring artist Iris, who becomes a model for Pre-Raphaelite artist Louis Frost on the condition that he teaches her to paint. But she‚Äôs also been noticed by Silas Reed, a sinister collector who is obsessed by strange and beautiful things. An atmospheric book that will stay with you long after you‚Äôve finished reading."

Once there, Vivian makes firm friends with the showgirls, throws herself into their hedonistic lifestyle and learns some tough lessons. Glamorous and vivid, with fascinating historical detail.'
